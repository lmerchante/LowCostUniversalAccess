#### Abstract:

Government-imposed lock-downs have challenged academic institutions to transition from traditional face-to-face education into hybrid or fully remote learning models. This transition has focused on the technological  challenge  to  guarantee  the  continuity  of  sound  pedagogy  and  to  grant  safe  access  to online digital university services. However, a key requisite involves adapting the evaluation process aswell. In response to this need, the authors of this paper tailored and implemented a cloud deployment to provide universal access to online summative assessment of university students in a computer programming course that mirrored a traditional in-person monitored computer laboratory under strictly controlled exam conditions. This deployment proved easy to integrate with the university systems and many commercial proctoring tools. This cloud deployment is not only a solution for extraordinary situations, it can also be adapted to be used daily for online collaborative coding assignments, practical lab sessions, formative assessments, and masterclasses where the students connect using their own equipment. Connecting from home facilitates access to education for students with physical dis-abilities. It also allows participation and participating with their studentâ€™s own adapted equipment in  the  evaluation  processes,  simplifying  assessment  for  those  with  hearing  or  visual  impairments.This  solution  has proven  to  be cheaper  and  more  flexible  than on-premise  equivalent  installations
